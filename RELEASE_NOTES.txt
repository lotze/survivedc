Map still displays checkpoints after game is over


1.0: SurviveDC 2012

* sign up for survivedc
* see the map
* see the rules
* check in at a location
* check your position
* see twitter feed
* redirect non-logged-in-users to main page
* sign in/sign up/homebuttons
* email user their new temporary password (set it in controller?)
* "home" buttons on sub-pages
* seed checkpoints
* reset password link on login page
* users can reset their password
* users can authenticate their email
* users can log in with their password
* make sure can't create two users with same email or username
* visible error messages on failed login
* after checkin, redirect to status
* enable dreamhost cloudflare speedup
* status time in Eastern time
* add rules
* buttons should be CSS, not images (and nice widths as percentage of screen)
* get location on access + store in DB (location_updates)
* redirect app mail to me
* capitalize code when sending down; downcase when comparing in database
* when viewing map, refresh (and log) location every 5 minutes
* map automatically follows location when it changes
* check location when checking in; try to auto-find checkpoint
* round display of distance to nearest 0.1 when showing skeptical face
* ask for manual entry if more than 0.15 miles away
* play with location and see if 0.15 miles seems right (and if distance is correct)
* fix formatting on auto-checkin
* record lat, long, accuracy on checkins
* convert button auto-checkin to form/post (and make it look right)
* allow team names in signup
* let users know their username will be public
* increase font size (for twitter/rules/check in)
* figure out why width is limited on rules
* allow friending
 - on status page, form to request a friend
 - when friend requested, check to see if this user has verified their email address; if so, create request; otherwise, direct to notice page
 - when friend requested, send email to target friend with code to approve
 - when friend approved, display notice and link to request that they friend you back
 - when on status page, display approved friends' num_checkpoints and most recent checkin location
 - when on map page, display friends' locations (on click, see name and last update time)...maybe just 10 most recent updates total?
* better landing page for non-member invite recipients?
* indicate whether checkin was automatic or manual
* log out button lower down (at bottom of screen, maybe?
* change map_on and game_on back
* change last checkin range in map_controller to be MINUTES instead of DAYS
* set map_on and game_on to expire around 4AM (so as not to keep providing location updates ;)
* name checkpoint examples better (give full list, including Finish; also change map icons to say in words)
